        <div class="para1"><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our website has many blocked games, AIs, hacks, browsers, and many other websites to keep you from going rogue of boredom. Theres no way to get bored on this site because, we have literally everything you need if your wanting to make your school chromebook feel more engaging.  
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One example, is proxiGPT. it is a remake of chatGPT with better features, and best of all, you don't need a API key. if that's not exciting enough, We have openAI playground, which has almost every type of AI ever made excluding chatGPT. (That's why we have proxiGPT.) So we have everything you need for your next graded essay. (now that I think of it, i should of used an AI to generate the document.)
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Our most favorite content are our hacks. We have many hacks including, Gimkit, Blooket, and ETC. "Out of all, I think gimkit hacks are the best, because hacking gimkit is very hard because the program is so advance." Alex K.(AK-47) I agree with alex, because he is right that the gimkit program is very advance and has high anti-cheat systems. 
        <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You think its already impossible to have this many things, But we are only a half of the way through what we got. introducing 123456789, (brave remake) A slow, but smart browser you can use for literally anything. you could search stuff up that I can't say or this website would be innapropriate. best of all I made it through replit (technically I forked it)
